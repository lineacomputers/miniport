This is Miniport, a fully responsive HTML5 site template designed by n33
and released for free by HTML5 Up! It features a simple, modern design, solid HTML5
and CSS3 code, and full responsive support for desktop, tablet, and mobile displays.

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)

PS: This site template is fully responsive, meaning it'll look great on desktop 
(widescreen and standard), tablet and mobile device displays. To see what this looks
like, just resize your browser window.

PPS: As of version 2.0 Miniport now uses my new + lightweight 5grid.js framework, which
is a complete rewrite of the original 5grid. As of this moment (4/10/2013) I haven't
publicly released it yet so if something seems fuxored in the meantime PLEASE let me know!
